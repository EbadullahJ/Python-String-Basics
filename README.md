# Python Strings Basics

This repository contains a Python script demonstrating the basics of strings in Python. It provides examples and explanations to help beginners understand different ways to create and use strings in Python. The script is well-documented and covers key features of string manipulation.

## Features
- **Creating Strings**: Examples of creating strings using single quotes, double quotes, and triple quotes.
- **Multiline Strings**: Using triple quotes to create strings that span multiple lines.
- **String Representation of Numbers**: Demonstrating how numbers can be represented as strings and their type.
- **Use of `type()`**: To identify the class of a given object.
- **Consistent Output Examples**: Each example includes expected output to make it easier to understand.

## Detailed Examples
Below are the topics covered in the script, with brief explanations:

### 1. Single Quotes
You can create strings using single quotes.
```python
print('Hello, World!')  # Output: Hello, World!
```

### 2. Double Quotes
Strings can also be created using double quotes. These are interchangeable with single quotes.
```python
print("Hello, World!")  # Output: Hello, World!
```

### 3. Triple Quotes
Triple quotes are useful for creating multiline strings or docstrings.
```python
print("""This is a
multiline string.
It spans several lines.""")
# Output:
# This is a
# multiline string.
# It spans several lines.
```

### 4. Numbers as Strings
Numbers enclosed in quotes are treated as strings in Python. You can check their type using `type()`.
```python
print("01234")  # Output: 01234
print(type("01234"))  # Output: <class 'str'>
```
